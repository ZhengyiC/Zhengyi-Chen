Lucia was visiting an old library located in a desolate tower on January 27th. The library was filled with smell of old books, and she was there to find a manual for her Organic Chemistry lab. To her surprise, she heard the sound of water flow. She traced the sound and discovered a well inside the library. The room with the well was super dark. She looked down to the well due to curiosity, and----her glasses fell from her face and sank to the water.
