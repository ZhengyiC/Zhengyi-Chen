Lucia was visiting an old library located in a desolate tower on January 27th. The library was filled with smell of old books, and she was there to find a manual for her Organic Chemistry lab. To her surprise, she heard the sound of water flow. She traced the sound and discovered a well inside the library. The room with the well was super dark. She looked down to the well due to curiosity, and----her glasses fell from her face and sank to the water. There in the water was a small creature swimming without a care. A small creature that eerily looked similar to a small version of a textbook actually. It flapped it's pages to stay afloat and paddled around the water, in a leisurely fashion. Lucia gasped and stumbled back in surprise, not believing what her eyes were seeing. A textbook creature? She had to be dreaming! She took a step forward to get a closer look into the well, and the creature was now using her glasses as some type of makeshift boat to stay afloat. What are she gonna do? Should she call librarian? police? or upload to Instagram live? She took her phone out of her pocket but there was no signal so she can't call anyone. She wanted to get out of this wired room but the door was locked. No one can help her, she had to figure out the situation by heself. She shouted to the creature "Who is there? What are you? Why do you lock me here?"
